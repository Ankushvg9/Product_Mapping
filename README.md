Product Mapping System

Here's how you can structure your GitHub repository for the Product Mapping System that uses HTML, JavaScript, and MongoDB.

GitHub Repository Structure:<br>
product-mapping-system/<br><br>
├── index.html                # The main HTML file for the UI<br>
├── script.js                 # JavaScript file for handling logic<br>
├── server.js                 # Node.js server to interact with MongoDB<br>
├── package.json              # Node.js package manager file<br>
├── .gitignore                # Git ignore file<br>
└── README.md                 # Documentation about the project<br><br>

Example Commit Messages:<br><br>
🚀 Add basic HTML structure for product mapping UI<br>
🔧 Fix JS logic for automatic mapping of product names<br>
📄 Update README to include assumptions and use cases<br>
📝 Add MongoDB schema for product mapping dictionary<br>
✅ Implement edge case handling for product name variations<br><br>

Can Handle:<br><br>
Manual entry of product names.<br>
Automatic matching of product names using predefined rules.<br>
Case-insensitive matching and handling common abbreviations.<br>
Adding new variations and updating the mapping dictionary.<br><br>
Can't Handle:<br><br>
Complex product name variations that require deep learning or AI-based solutions.<br>
Inaccurate or misspelled product names that don’t match any known pattern.<br><br>
Example Future Improvements:<br><br>
AI-based: Integrating a machine learning model for dynamic product name matching.<br>
Bulk Import: Support for importing large lists of products and automatically mapping them.<br>
User Feedback: Allow users to provide feedback on inaccurate matches to improve the dictionary.
